# This file is used by Puppet to track sites and mods being enabled/disabled 
# and knowing when to restart Apache.  This is done by maintaining a list of
# enabled and disabled sites and mods here.
#
# When puppet detects a change to this file (by changing any of the lists of
# sites or mods), it will exec a2dissite, a2ensite, a2dismod and a2enmod with
# the complete list of mods and trigger an Apache2 restart.
#
# Enabled modules: 
# alias auth_basic authn_file authz_default authz_groupfile authz_host authz_user autoindex cgi dir env headers mime negotiation php5 reqtimeout rewrite setenvif ssl status
#
# Disabled modules:
